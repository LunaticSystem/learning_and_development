# SECTION 10: Design Install Cluster

## Design a Kubernetes Cluster
* Education
  * Minikube
  * Single node cluster with kubeadm/GCP/AWS
* Developement & Testing
  * Multi-node cluster with a Single Master and multiple workers
  * Setup using kubeadm tool or quick provision on GCP, AWS, or AKS.
* Hosting production applications
  * High Availability Multi node cluster with multiple master nodes
  * Kubeadm or GCP or Kops or AWS or other supported platforms
  * Up to 5000 nodes
  * Up to 150,000 PODs in the cluster
  * Up to 300,000 Total containers
  * Up to 100 PODs per node.
* Storage
  * High performance - SSD Backed Storage
  * Multiple concurrent connections - Network based storage
  * Persistent shared volumes for shared access across multiple PODs
  * Label nodes with specific disk types
  * Use Node Selectors to assign applications to nodes with specific disk types.
